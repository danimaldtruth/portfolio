<p><strong>About Us</strong>
<p>The Alliance of Hope for Suicide Loss Survivors, a 501(c)3 charitable nonprofit, provides healing support for people who have lost loved ones to suicide.&nbsp;It was founded in 2008 by Ronnie Walker, a licensed clinical mental health counselor who lost her stepson to suicide in 1995.</p>

<p><strong>The Alliance of Hope is a non-denominational and non-discriminating non-profit that recognizes and appreciates each contribution to the quality of life.</strong>&nbsp;Our staff, volunteers, community members and clients are survivors from diverse cultures and faith traditions, bound together by similar loss. We are committed to providing an environment that is free from discrimination in employment and opportunity because of race, color, religion, creed, national origin, ancestry, disability, gender, sexual orientation, or age.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Our Mission:&nbsp;</strong><em>Kindness matters. For those who've lost a loved one to suicide, it matters a lot. We exist to provide healing, compassionate support to those who are suffering through the lonely and tumultuous aftermath of suicide. Our services help people survive and go beyond just surviving, to lead productive lives filled with meaning and joy.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><strong>According to the World Health Organization, approximately one million people die by suicide annually.</strong> For each of those victims, six to eight other people are profoundly affected by a devastating grief.</p>

<p><strong>In the U.S. alone, 4.7 million people are dealing with the aftermath of suicide.</strong>&nbsp;Those left behind —husbands, wives, parents, children, siblings, friends — grapple with debilitating emotions, and complex personal challenges. Many who have gone through the experience say they never knew such pain existed. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>It is our aim to ensure that no survivor goes without the support they need.&nbsp;</strong>Since our founding, we have helped thousands of survivors from many cultures and faith traditions all over the world. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

It is supervised by a <em>mental health counselor&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>trained team of survivor moderators who provide information and hope. </em>Many members tell us it is their “lifeline.”&nbsp;</p>
